                    <p>     Ready 4 Food is a food sharing website that targets those who are new to cooking or looking for inspiration to try out new recipes. Our idea came up in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic where people were quarnited in their homes. A consequence of this pandemic was that people were reliant on their ability to make food at home. For those who are experienced in home cooking, there was no problem; But for those who are not experienced, making food is a daunting challenge. This challenge is what we, Ready 4 Food, want to help with and we hope to achieve this by having a platform that is easy to use and accessable.</p>


                    <p>     Outside of being a place to find recipes, Ready 4 Food is also intended to be a social platform where people can comment and react to recipes they like or dislike. Our goal for incorporating a social platform on our webpage is to cultivate a community that can relate to experimenting with new food.
